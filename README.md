# Liveblink

Liveblink is a CLI (command line interface) that streamlines the process of watching Twitch streams via [livestreamer](http://livestreamer.io). It has some nice features such as an easy-access favorites list, and the ability to watch the streamer's latest VOD.

## Installation

Make sure you have livestreamer installed. You can find it at [livestreamer.io](http://livestreamer.io)

Open terminal (or your prefered alternative) and type:

    $ gem install liveblink


If you get an error, it's likely a problem with ruby. You can test if your ruby is working by typing:
	
	$ ruby -v

If you get another error, then you'll need to reinstall ruby. There are a lot of guides on the web on how to do this, so some google searching should help you accomplish this. If you get some output detailing a version, then ruby is not the problem. You can google the error or ask me directly (my email is nickomang@gmail.com)
